# Sample_App
Sample_app is a miniture project for Rails practice. It is based on [this](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter) tutorial and includes lots of the new rails concepts I have been learning.

The project is deployed as of June 2017. Check it out [here](https://sample-app-jw.herokuapp.com/). Feel free to login with
